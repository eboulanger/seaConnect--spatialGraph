This scripts takes a propagule dispersal matrix and
- produces spatial graphs of the propagule connectivity
- calculates the shortest path between previously unconnected nodes
- visualizes the number of steps in these shortest paths (MS Figure 3)
- visualizes an explicit example of a shortest path to illustrate the approach (Supplementary Material Figure A3)
